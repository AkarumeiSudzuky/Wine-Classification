# Wine-Classification
This project explores the classification of wine data using two different machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Neural Network. It involves preprocessing the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and evaluating the performance of both models. 

Technologies Used:
Python
Google Colab
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
NumPy
